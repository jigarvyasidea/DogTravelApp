# Dog Travel App

This is a quick little demo app that explores different features in Flutter like Rive animations, leveraging SVGs, importing custom fonts, using plugins and leveraging local storage to better understand the needs of iOS developers and design agencies. In this app, users are able to create a little timeline of their dog's life by selecting an album (max 14 photos) of their pup. 

Note that font assets are not included due to licensing.
